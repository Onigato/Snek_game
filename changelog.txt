v0.1.1:
CHANGED - 
countTime and cycleTime are now floats, a hell of a lot smaller, and countTime is now incremented by fElapsedTime
Food collision algorithm now looks one step ahead of the snake, and therefore SHOULDN'T phase through walls, and corners technically cease being as much a problem

v0.1.2
ADDED - 
game reset system - You hit things, you die. You die, you reset -- WIP!!

FIXED - 
wall collisions weren't happening in the right place

v0.1.3
FIXED - 
game reset system now functions correctly
minor bug when turning directly into grabbing food
